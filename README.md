# mocapController
 
Turn a [Vicon](vicon.com) motion capture system into a MIDI controller.

Start with [controller.py](https://github.com/hellothisistim/mocapController/blob/main/controller.py).
Explore the sample [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) modular synthesis patches. (*.vcv)

You will need to have the [Vicon DataStream SDK](https://www.vicon.com/software/datastream-sdk/) installed for live use. Comes with dummy data generation so you can set up with out needing a live stream from the Vicon system.

May need [loopMIDI](http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) on Windows to create virtual MIDI ports.
